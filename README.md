# apostrophe-rss

apostrophe-rss is a widget for the [Apostrophe](http://github.com/punkave/apostrophe) content management system. Apostrophe lets you display an RSS feed in any content area created with Jot. apostrophe-rss is also intended as a demonstration of how to add custom widgets to Jot and enable their use in your project. In particular, while apostrophe-twitter uses a browser-side player to load the actual feed, apostrophe-rss uses a server-side load function. See [apostrophe-wiki](http://github.com/punkave/apostrophe-wiki) for a project that demonstrates how to use apostrophe-rss.
