# jot-rss

jot-rss is a widget for the [Jot](http://github.com/boutell/jot) rich content editor. jot-rss lets you display an RSS feed in any content area created with Jot. jot-rss is also intended as a demonstration of how to add custom widgets to Jot and enable their use in your project. In particular, while jot-twitter uses a browser-side player to load the actual feed, jot-rss uses a server-side load function. See [jotwiki](http://github.com/boutell/jotwiki) for a project that demonstrates how to use jot-rss.
